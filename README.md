## Project Overview

This portfolio website is a responsive, single-page application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a Front-End Web Developer. The website is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.

### Key Features:
- *Responsive Design*: The website is mobile-friendly and looks great on all devices.
- *Interactive Sections*: Includes interactive sections like a resume button and links to projects.
- *Professional Appearance*: Clean layout and modern design to make a strong impression.
- *Dark Mode Toggle*: Users can switch between dark mode and light mode, with their preference saved in the browser.
- *Image Sliders*: Each project card has an interactive image slider to showcase multiple project images.

## Technologies Used

- *HTML*: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- *CSS*: To style and position the elements for a modern look.
- *JavaScript*: For interactivity, such as handling button clicks and form submissions.
- *JSON*: Used for managing data in a structured format.
- *Font Awesome*: For adding icons to improve the visual appeal.
- *Media Queries*: For responsive design that works on all screen sizes.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with the project, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arisha004/PORTFOLIO_WEBSITE_ARISHA.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PORTFOLIO_WEBSITE_ARISHA
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the website.

4. If you want to modify the website, you can edit the HTML, CSS, and JS files directly. Ensure you refresh your browser to see the changes.

## File Structure

Here is a brief overview of the files in the project:

```
/PORTFOLIO_WEBSITE_ARISHA
    /index.html            # The main HTML file of the website
    /style.css             # The CSS file for styling the website
    /script.js             # JavaScript for interactive elements
    /data.json             # JSON file used for managing data
```

### HTML File (`index.html`):
This file contains the main structure of the website, including the header, content sections, and footer.

### CSS File (`style.css`):
Contains all the styles and media queries to make the website responsive and visually appealing.

### JavaScript File (`script.js`):
Manages the functionality, such as button clicks, and provides interactivity. Key features include:
- **Toggle Navigation Menu**: The navigation menu can be toggled open or closed by clicking the toggle button.
- **Project Sliders**: Each project card contains an interactive image slider that users can navigate using previous and next buttons.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking on anchor links scrolls smoothly to the targeted section of the page.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between dark and light modes, with the preference saved in `localStorage` for future visits.

### JSON File (`data.json`):
Stores data for different sections (e.g., project details, skills, etc.) in a structured format that can be dynamically loaded and displayed on the website.

I have used PostImage for free image hosting to reduce file sizes, which is a more efficient approach for faster website loading and better performance.

## Features

- *Header*: Displays the websiteâ€™s title and navigation options.
- *Portfolio Section*: Showcases your skills, projects, and contact information.
- *Responsive Design*: Uses media queries to ensure the website looks good on all devices.
- *Footer*: Contains a copyright statement and other relevant links.
- *Navigation Menu Toggle*: Allows users to toggle the visibility of the navigation menu.
- *Image Sliders*: Each project card features an interactive image slider to display project images.
- *Dark Mode Toggle*: Enables users to switch between light and dark modes, with their preference saved in localStorage.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional animations for smoother transitions and interactivity.
- Improve the performance and accessibility of the website by optimizing images and ensuring better keyboard navigation.
